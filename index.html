        <strong>Q: Explain the significance of the Mehrgarh excavation. (10 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The excavation at Mehrgarh, located in present-day Baluchistan (Pakistan), is one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in South Asia. It provides the earliest evidence of agriculture, domestication of animals, and settled life in the Indian subcontinent, dating back to 7000 BCE. Below are the key aspects of its significance:<br><br>
        
        <strong>1. Earliest Farming Community:</strong> Mehrgarh is the earliest known site where people practiced agriculture and animal domestication. Crops like wheat and barley were cultivated, and animals like cattle, sheep, and goats were domesticated.<br><br>
        
        <strong>2. Transition from Hunting to Farming:</strong> The site shows a clear transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a food-producing society, marking the beginning of the Neolithic period in South Asia.<br><br>
        
        <strong>3. Permanent Settlements:</strong> Evidence of mud-brick houses, storage facilities, and burial grounds indicates the development of organized and settled village life.<br><br>
        
        <strong>4. Burial Practices and Social Structure:</strong> Burials with goods like tools and ornaments suggest belief in afterlife and an emerging social hierarchy.<br><br>
        
        <strong>5. Crafts and Trade:</strong> Artifacts like beads, pottery, and tools show early development of craftsmanship, with use of semi-precious stones hinting at long-distance trade links.<br><br>
        
        <strong>6. Link to Later Civilizations:</strong> Mehrgarh provides a cultural continuity to the Indus Valley Civilization, with many cultural elements, like pottery styles and subsistence methods, evolving further in Harappan sites.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Mehrgarh excavation is a landmark in understanding the origins of Indian civilization. It bridges the gap between prehistoric cultures and the Harappan Civilization, offering rich insights into early agricultural life, social organization, and cultural development.

        <strong>Q: Write a short note on the society of the Rig-Vedic period. (5 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The Rig-Vedic society was simple, tribal, and mostly pastoral. People lived in close-knit families where the father was the head, and society followed a patriarchal structure. Life revolved around cattle rearing, farming, and worship of natural forces like Indra, Agni, and Varuna. The social setup was beginning to take shape, with the early varna system—Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras—though it was not rigid yet. Women had a respectable position; some even composed hymns and took part in religious ceremonies. Overall, the society was dynamic, with room for social mobility, and was deeply rooted in religious beliefs and community values.

        <strong>Q: Discuss the difference between Buddhism and Jainism. (10 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Buddhism and Jainism both emerged in the 6th century BCE as reactions to the rigid rituals and caste system of Vedic religion. Though they share some ideas like non-violence, karma, and rebirth, they differ in many ways — especially in philosophy and practice. Below are the key differences:
        <h5><strong>1. Founders and Core Practices</strong></h5>
        <strong>Buddhism</strong> was founded by Gautama Buddha, who emphasized the Middle Path. <strong>Jainism</strong> promoted strict self-discipline through Mahavira.
        <h5><strong>2. Belief About the Soul</strong></h5>
        <strong>Buddhism</strong> believes in Anatta (no soul). <strong>Jainism</strong> believes in eternal soul (Jiva).
        <h5><strong>3. Goal of Liberation</strong></h5>
        <strong>Buddhism</strong>: Nirvana via Eightfold Path. <strong>Jainism</strong>: Moksha via austerity.
        <h5><strong>4. Approach to Non-Violence</strong></h5>
        <strong>Jainism</strong> follows extreme Ahimsa. <strong>Buddhism</strong> follows moderate Ahimsa.
        <h5><strong>5. Religious Texts and Language</strong></h5>
        <strong>Buddhist</strong> texts in Pali. <strong>Jain</strong> texts in Prakrit.
        <h5><strong>6. Monastic Life</strong></h5>
        <strong>Buddhist</strong> monks live in moderation. <strong>Jain</strong> monks follow extreme austerity.
        <h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
        Buddhism gained mass acceptance for its simplicity, while Jainism remained strict and ascetic.

        <strong>Q: Discuss shortly on Gandhara Art. (5 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Gandhara Art developed during the Kushan period, especially under Kanishka’s rule. It emerged in north-western India, mainly around present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan. This art is unique for its blend of Indian and Greco-Roman styles. The Buddha was shown for the first time in human form, wearing Roman-style robes, with curly hair and realistic facial features. Gandhara sculptures mainly focused on Buddhist themes, like scenes from Buddha’s life and Bodhisattvas. This style played a big role in spreading Buddhist art to Central Asia and beyond.

        <strong>Q: Comment on the religious life of the Harappans. (5 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The Harappan people had a religious life that was closely connected with nature and fertility worship. They worshipped a mother goddess, symbolizing fertility, and a male deity—possibly an early form of Lord Shiva, seen in the famous "Pashupati" seal. They also worshipped trees like Peepal, animals like bulls and unicorns (mythical), and practiced fire rituals in some places like Kalibangan. The presence of terracotta figurines, seals, and ritual bathing tanks (like the Great Bath) indicates a well-developed religious system. Overall, their religion was not temple-based, but had strong symbolic and ritualistic elements tied to nature, fertility, and purity.

        <strong>Q: Who was Chandragupta Maurya? (5 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Chandragupta Maurya was the founder of the Mauryan Empire and one of the greatest rulers in ancient Indian history. With the guidance of his mentor Chanakya (Kautilya), he overthrew the Nanda dynasty and established Mauryan rule around 321 BCE. He united most of India under a single administration for the first time, including parts of present-day Afghanistan. He defeated the Greek satraps left by Alexander and later signed a treaty with Seleucus Nicator, a Greek ruler, and even married his daughter. Chandragupta adopted Jainism in his later life and abdicated the throne in favor of his son, Bindusara. He spent his final years in Karnataka as a Jain monk, reflecting his spiritual side.

        <strong>Q: What were the main tenets of Ashoka’s Dhamma? (5 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Ashoka’s Dhamma was a set of moral and ethical principles meant to unite his vast empire and promote peace and harmony. It was not a new religion, but a code of conduct inspired by Buddhist values and humanism. The main tenets were:
        <h5><strong>1. Respect for Elders and Parents</strong></h5>
        People were encouraged to honor and care for their elders and parents.
        <h5><strong>2. Kindness to Animals and Generosity</strong></h5>
        It promoted kindness to animals and generosity towards all beings.
        <h5><strong>3. Religious Tolerance</strong></h5>
        It stressed mutual respect and tolerance among different religious communities.
        <h5><strong>4. Non-Violence (Ahimsa)</strong></h5>
        Non-violence was emphasized in personal life and state policies.
        <h5><strong>5. Truthfulness, Compassion, and Self-Control</strong></h5>
        It urged people to practice truth, compassion, and self-discipline daily.
        <br><br>
        Ashoka spread these ideas through his edicts carved on rocks and pillars across his empire, encouraging a just and moral life.

        <strong>Q: Write a short note on the Sixteen Mahajanapadas. (5 Marks)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Around the 6th century BCE, ancient India saw the rise of sixteen large states called Mahajanapadas. These were spread across the Gangetic plains and included well-known ones like Magadha, Kashi, Kosala, Avanti, Vajji, and Vatsa. The rise of Mahajanapadas was linked to agriculture, iron tools, trade, and growing urbanization. Some of these states had monarchical rule, while others, like Vajji, followed republican systems. They often engaged in wars for territory and power, and Magadha ultimately emerged as the most dominant one. The period of Mahajanapadas also witnessed the birth of Buddhism and Jainism, making it an important phase in Indian history.

        <strong>Answer:</strong> Jainism and Buddhism, both emerged in the 6th century BCE as reform movements against the growing rituals and inequalities in Vedic religion. Though similar in many ways, they also had important differences. Below are their key similarities and dissimilarities:
        <h5><strong>Similarities</strong></h5>
        <h5><strong>1. Founders from Kshatriya Class</strong></h5>
        Both were founded by Kshatriya princes—Mahavira (Jainism) and Gautama Buddha (Buddhism).
        <h5><strong>2. Rejection of Vedic Authority</strong></h5>
        They rejected the authority of the Vedas and opposed Brahmanical rituals and animal sacrifices.
        <h5><strong>3. Emphasis on Moral Living</strong></h5>
        Both emphasized moral living, non-violence (Ahimsa), and the concept of Karma and rebirth.
        <h5><strong>4. Focus on Liberation</strong></h5>
        They promoted simple living, meditation, and sought liberation (moksha) through personal efforts.
        <h5><strong>5. Use of Common Languages</strong></h5>
        Both encouraged the use of common languages (Prakrit and Pali) so that teachings reached the common people.

        <h5><strong>Dissimilarities</strong></h5>
        <h5><strong>1. Belief About the Soul</strong></h5>
        Jainism believes that the soul exists in every living being, while Buddhism denies a permanent soul (Anatta).
        <h5><strong>2. Approach to Non-Violence</strong></h5>
        Jainism follows extreme Ahimsa, Buddhism is less strict.
        <h5><strong>3. Origin and Founders</strong></h5>
        Mahavira was the 24th Tirthankara, not the founder. Gautama Buddha founded Buddhism.
        <h5><strong>4. Path to Liberation</strong></h5>
        Jainism practices severe asceticism. Buddhism follows the Middle Path.
        <h5><strong>5. Spread and Popularity</strong></h5>
        Buddhism spread widely across Asia, while Jainism remained more confined to India.
         <h5><strong>Conclusion</strong><h5
        <strong>In conclusion, both religions brought spiritual and social reform but had different paths toward liberation and philosophies about life and soul.</strong>

        <strong>Answer:</strong> In the reconstruction of ancient Indian history, inscriptions and coins play a vital role. Unlike literary sources, they are contemporary, direct pieces of evidence that provide factual data and help historians understand political, social, religious, and economic developments in ancient times.<br><br>

        <strong>1. Inscriptions:</strong> Inscriptions are texts engraved on stone, metal, terracotta, pillars, and temple walls. They serve as authentic and permanent records issued by kings, officials, or religious institutions.<br><br>

        One of the most significant collections of inscriptions are the Ashokan Edicts, which are found all over India. These inscriptions, written in Prakrit, Greek, Aramaic, and Kharosthi, offer insight into Ashoka's Dhamma, his policy of non-violence, respect for all religions, and administration. They show how a ruler communicated directly with his people.<br><br>

        Land grant inscriptions from the Gupta and post-Gupta period help us understand the feudal structure, donation practices, and growth of Brahmanical religion. Inscriptions also mention victories, royal genealogies, construction of temples, and social customs, giving a broad picture of life during that period.<br><br>

        Moreover, inscriptions have helped historians fix historical dates, such as the Hathigumpha inscription of Kharavela and the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudragupta, which provide a detailed account of their reigns.<br><br>

        <strong>2. Coins:</strong> Coins are another crucial archaeological source. They provide information about economy, trade, political authority, religion, and art.<br><br>

        The earliest coins in India were punch-marked coins made of silver, used during the Mahajanapada period. These help trace the beginning of monetized economy in India.<br><br>

        Later, the Indo-Greek, Kushan, and Gupta coins are especially valuable. For example, Kushan coins tell us about their kings, titles, religious affiliations (like worship of Shiva, Buddha, and Zoroastrian gods), and their vast trading network.<br><br>

        Gupta coins, with images of Samudragupta playing the veena or performing Ashvamedha, show the blend of culture, religion, and power. The high gold content in Gupta coins also reflects a prosperous economy.<br><br>

        Coins sometimes carry dates, portraits, and inscriptions which help identify the chronology of rulers and also provide evidence of foreign influence in India (like Indo-Greek and Roman coins).<br><br>

        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Inscriptions and coins serve as authentic windows into the past. While inscriptions offer written records, coins reflect the economic and political health of the empire. Together, they fill in the gaps left by literary texts and help historians build a clearer, more reliable picture of ancient Indian society.<br><br>

        They are not just pieces of stone or metal, but voices from history that speak of kings and kingdoms, art and administration, trade and temples. Their study continues to reshape and refine our understanding of ancient India.

        <strong>Q: To what extent was the Harappan Civilization an urban civilization? (10 Marks / 500 words)</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The Harappan Civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization (2600–1900 BCE), is considered one of the earliest urban civilizations in the world. Its urban nature is evident through its planned cities, architecture, trade system, social organization, and use of technology. The civilization flourished in the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent and showcased remarkable urban traits for its time.<br><br>

        <strong>1. Urban Planning and Architecture:</strong> One of the strongest pieces of evidence of Harappan urbanism is its well-planned city layout. Cities like Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Dholavira were built on a grid pattern, with streets crossing each other at right angles. These cities had a citadel (fortified area) and a lower town, separating the ruling class from common people.<br><br>

        Buildings were made with baked bricks of standard size, which indicates a centralized authority and organized construction. The presence of multi-roomed houses, public buildings, granaries, wells, and bathing areas reflect a sophisticated urban life.<br><br>

        <strong>2. Advanced Drainage and Sanitation:</strong> The Harappans had one of the most advanced drainage systems in the ancient world. Covered drains ran along the main roads, and every house was connected to this system, indicating concern for public hygiene. The Great Bath of Mohenjo-Daro is a clear example of their focus on cleanliness and water management.<br><br>

        <strong>3. Trade and Economy:</strong> Urban centers of Harappan civilization were also hubs of trade. Archaeological evidence suggests internal trade (with regions like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Deccan) and external trade with Mesopotamia, Oman, and Bahrain. Items like seals, beads, pottery, and metals were traded. Standardized weights and measures and a uniform system of script further prove the existence of an organized economic system.<br><br>

        The discovery of dockyards (e.g., Lothal), artifacts from distant lands, and standardized weights show that Harappan cities were centers of commercial activity.<br><br>

        <strong>4. Social Organization and Administration:</strong> Although no monumental palace or clear evidence of kings has been found, the uniformity in city planning and material culture across thousands of kilometers suggests a centralized administrative system. The uniform brick sizes, town layouts, and weights reflect regulation and control—important aspects of urban governance.<br><br>

        <strong>5. Art, Craft, and Writing:</strong> Urbanization also reflected in the development of arts and crafts. Harappans were skilled in pottery, metallurgy, bead-making, seal carving, and more. The Indus script, although undeciphered, was used widely—perhaps for record-keeping, trade, or religious purposes—another sign of complex urban life.<br><br>

        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> In conclusion, the Harappan Civilization was highly urban in character. It exhibited all key features of urbanization—planned cities, sanitation, trade networks, centralized administration, craft specialization, and a system of writing. While it may not have had large-scale monuments or known rulers like Mesopotamia or Egypt, the Harappans built cities that were far ahead of their time.<br><br>

        Thus, the Harappan Civilization was urban to a great extent, and its cities remain a model of ancient urban planning and civic life.

    <p><strong>Q1. Importance of India’s political life (10 Marks)</strong></p>
    <p>India’s ancient political life is significant for understanding the foundation of governance and power structures that shaped early civilizations. Below are the key aspects of its importance:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Rise of Mahajanapadas:</strong> The Mahajanapadas marked the rise of territorial states, reflecting the evolution from tribal communities to complex kingdoms. Among these, Magadha emerged as a powerful state due to its geographical position, rich natural resources, and efficient administration.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Mauryan Empire:</strong> The Mauryan Empire under Chandragupta Maurya and later Ashoka exemplified the first centralized and bureaucratic state in Indian history. The Arthashastra of Kautilya laid the foundation for statecraft, economic policies, and military organization.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Republican States (Ganarajyas):</strong> India also saw the development of republican states, known as Ganarajyas, where decision-making involved assemblies and public participation, reflecting early forms of democracy.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Influence of Religion:</strong> The political life was deeply connected with religion, especially under Ashoka, whose Dhamma policy blended moral responsibility with state administration.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These developments show how ancient India laid strong foundations of governance, diplomacy, military structure, and civil administration — making its political life a key aspect of its historical identity.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2. Fall of the Harappan Civilization (10 Marks)</strong></p>
    <p>The decline of the Harappan Civilization marks one of the earliest examples of urban collapse in ancient history. Multiple factors contributed to its downfall, which scholars continue to study and debate.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Climatic Change:</strong> One major reason was climatic change. Gradual drying of rivers like the Ghaggar-Hakra and the Indus led to water scarcity and agricultural decline. Floods and earthquakes may also have damaged key cities and disrupted life.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Decline in Trade:</strong> Another factor was the decline in trade. Harappans had extensive trade networks with Mesopotamia and regions of Central Asia. When these links weakened, their economy suffered. The disappearance of standardized weights and measures indicates a breakdown in commercial systems.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Social Unrest and Internal Conflicts:</strong> The civilization may have also collapsed due to social unrest or internal conflicts, as suggested by signs of sudden abandonment of cities and destruction of structures.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Theory of Invasion:</strong> There is also the theory of invasion by Indo-Aryans, though this is now considered less likely by many historians. Evidence does not strongly support a violent overthrow.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In conclusion, the fall of the Harappan Civilization was likely caused by a combination of environmental, economic, and social factors, leading to the gradual abandonment of urban centers and a shift to rural life.</p>

    <p><strong>Q3. Political and economic life of the Indus Valley Civilization (10 Marks)</strong></p>
    <p>The political and economic life of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) reveals an advanced and organized urban society. In terms of political structure, though no direct evidence of kings or a ruling class exists, the uniformity in city planning across vast regions — like Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Lothal — suggests a strong central authority or administrative control. The presence of granaries, citadels, and urban planning indicates regulation and coordination on a large scale, possibly governed by priest-kings or a council of elites.</p>
    <p>Economically, the civilization was agrarian-based. People cultivated wheat, barley, cotton, and other crops with the help of the fertile Indus plains and an advanced irrigation system. The discovery of dockyards and standardized weights implies a sophisticated trade system. They traded not only locally but also with distant regions like Mesopotamia, proven by Mesopotamian records mentioning “Meluhha” (believed to be Indus). The use of weights and measures, seals, and metal tools reflect their commercial development. Craft production such as bead-making, pottery, and metallurgy (copper, bronze) also played a major economic role.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The IVC showcased a well-structured society with a possibly centralized political system and a thriving economy built on agriculture, trade, and crafts, making it one of the most remarkable urban civilizations of the ancient world.</p>

        <h5><b>Q4:</b> <strong>Trade Relations with Rome</strong> (10 Marks)</h5><br>
        <h5>Answer:</h5><br>
        The trade relations between ancient India and Rome were a significant aspect of India’s economic history during the early centuries CE, particularly flourishing under the <strong>Satavahana</strong> and <strong>Kushan</strong> dynasties.<br><br>
        India exported a wide range of goods to the Roman Empire, including <strong>spices</strong>, <strong>textiles</strong> (especially fine muslin and silk), <strong>precious stones</strong>, <strong>ivory</strong>, and <strong>peacocks</strong>. In return, India imported <strong>gold and silver coins</strong>, <strong>wine</strong>, <strong>glassware</strong>, and luxury items. The discovery of Roman coins in large numbers in South India, especially <strong>Tamil Nadu</strong> and <strong>Kerala</strong>, highlights the intensity of trade.<br><br>
        The <strong>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</strong> (a 1st-century CE Greco-Roman text) and works of <strong>Pliny the Elder</strong> provide valuable insights into this trade. Indian ports like <strong>Arikamedu</strong>, <strong>Muziris</strong>, and <strong>Bharuch</strong> played crucial roles in maritime trade, acting as hubs for Roman merchants.<br><br>
        This trade brought prosperity to Indian kingdoms. The Roman gold influx strengthened local economies and enriched traders and ruling elites. However, Roman historians like <strong>Pliny</strong> criticized the excessive outflow of gold to India.<br><br>
        These Indo-Roman ties also influenced <strong>art</strong>, <strong>architecture</strong>, and cultural exchange. Roman <strong>pottery</strong>, <strong>glass</strong>, and art styles have been found in Indian archaeological sites, reflecting mutual impact.<br><br>
        In conclusion, Indo-Roman trade was not only commercially beneficial but also culturally enriching. It stands as a testimony to ancient India’s global economic connections and its importance in early international trade networks.

        <h5><strong>Q5: Administrative system of the Maurya period (10 Marks)</strong></h5><br><br>
        <h5>Answer:</h5><br><br>
        The Mauryan Empire, especially under <strong>Chandragupta Maurya</strong> and <strong>Ashoka</strong>, established one of the most well-organized and centralized administrative systems in ancient Indian history.<br><br>
        The empire was divided into provinces (like <strong>Taxila</strong>, <strong>Ujjain</strong>, <strong>Tosali</strong>) governed by royal princes or trusted officials. These provinces were further divided into districts and villages, each with their own administrative staff.<br><br>
        The central government was headed by the King, who was advised by a Council of Ministers. The <strong>Arthashastra</strong>, written by <strong>Kautilya</strong> (<strong>Chanakya</strong>), offers a detailed guide on governance, including taxation, espionage, foreign policy, and law enforcement.<br><br>
        A special feature of the Mauryan administration was the vast network of spies (referred to as <strong>"Gudhapurusha"</strong>) who reported directly to the emperor, ensuring tight control over the empire.<br><br>
        Under <strong>Ashoka</strong>, the administrative system incorporated moral governance. He appointed <strong>Dhamma Mahamattas</strong>, officials responsible for spreading ethical values, overseeing public welfare, and maintaining harmony among different religious groups.<br><br>
        The Mauryan bureaucracy included various officials such as <strong>Amatyas</strong> (ministers), <strong>Rajjukas</strong> (revenue officers), and <strong>Yukthas</strong> (executive officers). The capital city, <strong>Pataliputra</strong>, had a municipal committee system to manage urban affairs like sanitation, trade, and infrastructure.<br><br>
        The empire also maintained a standing army and had a well-planned system for tax collection, primarily based on land revenue.<br><br>
        In short, the Mauryan administration was marked by centralization, discipline, and moral responsibility, laying the foundation for future Indian administrative practices.

        <h5><b>Q6: Political and economic importance of the Kushan Era (10 Marks)</b></h5><br><br>
        <h5>Answer:</h5><br><br>
        The Kushan Era (1st to 3rd century CE), especially under rulers like <strong>Kanishka</strong>, played a pivotal role in shaping India’s political stability and economic prosperity.<br><br>
        <h5><strong>Political Importance</strong></h5><br><br>
        The Kushans unified vast territories across <strong>Central Asia</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, and <strong>North India</strong>, facilitating cross-cultural interaction.<br>
        <strong>Kanishka</strong>, the most renowned Kushan ruler, established a strong centralized administration with his capital at <strong>Purushapura</strong> (modern-day Peshawar).<br>
        He patronized <strong>Buddhism</strong>, especially the <strong>Mahayana</strong> sect, and convened the <strong>Fourth Buddhist Council</strong>. His support helped spread Buddhism to <strong>Central Asia</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, and beyond.<br>
        The Kushan rulers acted as cultural bridges between <strong>India</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Persia</strong>, and <strong>Rome</strong>, encouraging diplomatic and commercial ties.<br><br>
        <h5><strong>Economic Importance</strong></h5><br><br>
        The Kushan period saw the growth of international trade, especially along the <strong>Silk Route</strong>. Goods such as <strong>spices</strong>, <strong>textiles</strong>, and <strong>precious stones</strong> were exported to the <strong>Roman Empire</strong>.<br>
        They introduced <strong>gold coins</strong> in large numbers, reflecting a flourishing economy. These coins also depicted Indian deities and rulers, showing the blend of culture and commerce.<br>
        Urban centers like <strong>Mathura</strong>, <strong>Taxila</strong>, and <strong>Peshawar</strong> developed rapidly due to increased trade, crafts, and production.<br>
        The state supported artisans, traders, and builders, leading to the construction of <strong>stupas</strong>, <strong>monasteries</strong>, and <strong>sculptures</strong>.<br><br>
        In conclusion, the Kushan Era was not just politically unifying but also economically vibrant, making it one of the most influential periods in early Indian history.

        <h5><b>Q7: Ashoka’s concept of Dhamma (religious responsibility) (10 Marks)</b></h5><br><br>
        <h5>Answer:</h5><br><br>
        The concept of Dhamma under Emperor <strong>Ashoka</strong> was a unique blend of moral, spiritual, and social values, introduced after the devastating <strong>Kalinga War</strong>, which transformed Ashoka’s outlook from conquest to compassion.<br><br>
        <h5><strong>Ashoka’s Dhamma</strong></h5><br><br>
        <strong>Ashoka’s Dhamma</strong> was not a new religion but a code of conduct meant to promote peace, tolerance, and social harmony across his diverse empire. He emphasized values like:<br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Respect for elders and teachers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Non-violence (<strong>Ahimsa</strong>) towards humans and animals</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Religious tolerance and mutual respect between sects</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Kindness, truthfulness, and charity</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Opposition to superstition and meaningless rituals</strong></li>
        </ul><br><br>
        Ashoka spread his Dhamma through edicts inscribed on rocks and pillars across the empire in local languages, making it accessible to common people. He appointed special officers called <strong>Dhamma Mahamatras</strong> to propagate these values and oversee the moral welfare of society.<br><br>
        By promoting Dhamma, Ashoka aimed to create a just and compassionate society, where rulers were seen as moral guardians rather than just power-holders. His efforts also helped in the spread of <strong>Buddhism</strong> beyond India, to <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, <strong>Central Asia</strong>, and <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>.<br><br>
        Thus, Ashoka’s Dhamma became a guiding principle for good governance and ethical living, leaving a deep impact on Indian history and world civilization.

        <h5><b>Q8: Reasons and outcomes of Alexander’s invasion of India (10 Marks)</b></h5><br><br>
        <h5>Answer:</h5><br><br>
        Alexander’s invasion of India in 326 BCE marked a significant encounter between the Greek and Indian worlds. Though short-lived, it had important political, military, and cultural consequences.<br><br>
        <h5>Reasons for the invasion:</h5><br><br>
        Ambition to conquer the known world: After subduing the <strong>Persian Empire</strong>, <strong>Alexander</strong> aimed to reach the eastern limits of the world, which included India.<br>
        Wealth of India: Stories of India’s immense riches attracted Alexander, who sought both glory and economic gain.<br>
        Strategic expansion: He wanted to create a continuous empire from <strong>Greece</strong> to the <strong>Indus Valley</strong>.<br><br>
        <h5>Outcomes of the invasion:</h5><br><br>
        Defeat of Indian kings: Alexander defeated King <strong>Porus</strong> at the Battle of the <strong>Hydaspes</strong> (Jhelum), though impressed by Porus’s bravery, he reinstated him as a subordinate ruler.<br>
        Limited conquest: His troops refused to march further east after reaching the <strong>Beas River</strong>, fearing the powerful kingdoms ahead like <strong>Magadha</strong>.<br>
        Cultural exchange: The invasion brought Hellenistic influences into Indian <strong>art</strong>, <strong>architecture</strong>, and <strong>coinage</strong>—visible later in the <strong>Gandhara School of Art</strong>.<br>
        Opening of trade routes: His campaign improved contacts between India and the West, boosting commercial and cultural interactions.<br>
        Political vacuum: After Alexander’s withdrawal and death, his generals left behind unstable territories, allowing new powers like the <strong>Maurya Empire</strong> to rise under <strong>Chandragupta Maurya</strong>.<br><br>
        Though Alexander’s rule didn’t last in India, the invasion played a vital role in reshaping the political and cultural landscape of the subcontinent.

        <b>Q3: Features of the Harappan Civilization (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>Harappan Civilization</strong>, also known as the <strong>Indus Valley Civilization</strong>, was one of the earliest urban cultures in the world (c. 2600–1900 BCE). It had well-planned cities like <strong>Harappa</strong>, <strong>Mohenjo-Daro</strong>, and <strong>Dholavira</strong> with grid-pattern streets. The cities had an advanced drainage system, public baths, and granaries. People lived in burnt brick houses and practiced <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>crafts</strong>, and <strong>trade</strong>. They used <strong>weights and measures</strong> for trade and had contacts with <strong>Mesopotamia</strong>. The Harappans had no clear evidence of kings, but their society seemed highly organized. The civilization showed a high level of urban planning, craftsmanship, and trade, making it a remarkable early civilization.</p>

        <b>Q4: Role of women in the Kushan era (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>During the <strong>Kushan era</strong> (1st to 3rd century CE), women enjoyed a relatively respected position in society, especially in urban and elite settings. Women were seen participating in religious and cultural activities, particularly in <strong>Buddhism</strong>. <strong>Kushan art</strong> often depicted female figures like <strong>Yakshinis</strong> and goddesses, reflecting their cultural importance. Some inscriptions from the period mention women as donors to Buddhist <strong>monasteries</strong> and <strong>stupas</strong>, indicating their economic role. While patriarchy was still dominant, certain women from royal or wealthy families held influence in public and spiritual life.</p>

        <b>Q5: Caste system during the Maurya period (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>During the <strong>Maurya period</strong>, the varna system was prevalent and society was broadly divided into four main classes — <strong>Brahmins</strong>, <strong>Kshatriyas</strong>, <strong>Vaishyas</strong>, and <strong>Shudras</strong>. This classification was mainly based on occupation and birth. The <strong>Arthashastra</strong> by <strong>Kautilya</strong> mentions the importance of maintaining social order through this structure. However, evidence suggests that the rigidity of caste was still developing, and there was some mobility based on skill and merit, especially in urban and administrative centers. <strong>Ashoka’s Dhamma</strong> promoted social harmony, respect across castes, and condemned discrimination. His inscriptions emphasized tolerance and compassion among people from all backgrounds.</p>

        <b>Q6: Religion of the Vedic Civilization (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>The religion of the <strong>Vedic Civilization</strong> was based on nature worship and a deep belief in rituals and sacrifices. People worshipped natural forces like <strong>Agni</strong> (fire), <strong>Indra</strong> (rain god), <strong>Surya</strong> (sun), and <strong>Varuna</strong> (water). The <strong>Rigveda</strong>, the oldest Veda, contains hymns dedicated to these gods. The religion was <strong>polytheistic</strong>, meaning belief in many gods, and rituals were performed by priests (<strong>Brahmins</strong>). Over time, religious practices became more complex, and philosophical ideas like <strong>karma</strong> (action), <strong>dharma</strong> (duty), and <strong>moksha</strong> (liberation) started to evolve. The later Vedic period saw the rise of the <strong>Upanishads</strong>, which shifted focus from rituals to internal spiritual knowledge.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Q7: Jainism (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jainism</strong> is one of the oldest religions of India, founded by <strong>Lord Mahavira</strong>, the 24th Tirthankara. It teaches the path of <strong>non-violence (Ahimsa)</strong>, <strong>truth (Satya)</strong>, <strong>non-stealing (Asteya)</strong>, <strong>celibacy (Brahmacharya)</strong>, and <strong>non-possession (Aparigraha)</strong>. Jains believe in the eternity of the soul and the cycle of birth and rebirth (<strong>samsara</strong>). Liberation (<strong>moksha</strong>) is achieved through <strong>right faith</strong>, <strong>right knowledge</strong>, and <strong>right conduct</strong> — known as the Three Jewels (<strong>Triratna</strong>). Jain monks live a very strict life and avoid harming even the smallest living beings. <strong>Jainism</strong> rejects the authority of the <strong>Vedas</strong> and emphasizes personal discipline and self-purification.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Q8: Spiritual Religion (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Spiritual religion</strong> focuses on personal connection with the divine rather than rituals or external practices. In ancient India, this idea grew through <strong>Upanishadic philosophy</strong>, which emphasized the concept of <strong>Atman</strong> (soul) and <strong>Brahman</strong> (universal soul). It promotes inner realization, meditation, and self-discipline as a means to achieve <strong>moksha</strong> (liberation). Both <strong>Jainism</strong> and <strong>Buddhism</strong> are examples of spiritual religions that stress ethical living, mental purity, and detachment from material desires. <strong>Spiritual religion</strong> helped shift people’s focus from ritual sacrifices to a deeper understanding of life and the universe.</p>

        <b>Q9: Comparative Study Between Brahmanism and Hinduism (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Brahmanism</strong> was an early religious tradition based on <strong>Vedic texts</strong>, rituals, and the dominance of the <strong>Brahmin</strong> priestly class. It emphasized <strong>yajnas</strong> (sacrifices), social hierarchy, and the <strong>Varna system</strong>. <strong>Hinduism</strong>, which evolved later, included the philosophical teachings of the <strong>Upanishads</strong>, the devotional practices (<strong>bhakti</strong>), and worship of deities like <strong>Vishnu</strong>, <strong>Shiva</strong>, and <strong>Devi</strong>. It became more inclusive and flexible, incorporating local traditions and spiritual paths. While <strong>Brahmanism</strong> focused on rituals and priestly authority, <strong>Hinduism</strong> allowed personal devotion, spiritual growth, and diverse practices, making it more accessible to common people.</p>

        <b>Q10. Religious Texts (5 Marks)</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>Ancient Indian religious texts played a vital role in shaping the spiritual and philosophical foundation of the subcontinent.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Vedas</strong> are the earliest texts, containing hymns, rituals, and spiritual knowledge. They include the <strong>Rigveda</strong>, <strong>Samaveda</strong>, <strong>Yajurveda</strong>, and <strong>Atharvaveda</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Upanishads</strong> explored deeper philosophical questions, such as the nature of the soul (<strong>Atman</strong>) and the universal spirit (<strong>Brahman</strong>).</p>
        <p>The <strong>Ramayana</strong> and <strong>Mahabharata</strong>, two great epics, conveyed moral values and <strong>dharma</strong> through stories of ideal characters like <strong>Rama</strong> and <strong>Krishna</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Tripitaka</strong> (in Buddhism) and the <strong>Agamas</strong> (in Jainism) are important religious texts that record the teachings of <strong>Buddha</strong> and <strong>Mahavira</strong>, respectively.</p>
        <p>These texts continue to guide religious, ethical, and philosophical thought in Indian society.</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>Emperor <strong>Ashoka</strong>, after witnessing the devastation of the <strong>Kalinga War</strong>, embraced <strong>Buddhism</strong> and made it the guiding principle of his rule.</p>

        <b>Q12. Reforms (Social/Religious) – 5 Marks</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>Ancient India witnessed several social and religious reforms that played a key role in shaping its cultural fabric.</p>
        <p>During the <strong>Buddhist</strong> and <strong>Jain</strong> movements, reformers like <strong>Gautama Buddha</strong> and <strong>Mahavira</strong> challenged the caste system, ritual sacrifices, and Brahmanical dominance. They promoted values like <strong>non-violence</strong>, <strong>truth</strong>, <strong>equality</strong>, and simple living.</p>
        <p><strong>Ashoka</strong> also introduced reforms after adopting <strong>Buddhism</strong>, focusing on <strong>Dhamma</strong>, which promoted tolerance, compassion, and moral behavior.</p>
        <p>These reforms emphasized personal ethics over rituals, and inspired social change by encouraging respect for all beings, charity, and service to humanity.</p>
        <p>Such movements brought religious freedom, inspired new sects, and strengthened ethical foundations of Indian society.</p>

        <b>Q13. Ideals and Features of Vedic Religion and Hinduism – 5 Marks</b>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>Vedic religion</strong> was centered around the worship of nature gods like <strong>Agni</strong>, <strong>Indra</strong>, and <strong>Varuna</strong>. It emphasized rituals, <strong>yajnas</strong> (sacrifices), and the chanting of Vedic hymns by <strong>Brahmins</strong>. The society followed a <strong>varna system</strong>, where duties were based on caste.</p>
        <p>Later, <strong>Hinduism</strong> evolved from Vedic traditions, incorporating new philosophies, deities like <strong>Vishnu</strong>, <strong>Shiva</strong>, and <strong>Devi</strong>, and the idea of <strong>karma</strong>, <strong>dharma</strong>, and <strong>moksha</strong>. It gave more space for devotional worship (<strong>bhakti</strong>) and personal spiritual practices.</p>
        <p>While <strong>Vedic religion</strong> was more ritualistic, <strong>Hinduism</strong> became more inclusive, allowing different paths like <strong>bhakti</strong>, <strong>karma</strong>, and <strong>jnana</strong> to attain spiritual growth.</p>
        <p>Both share common roots, but <strong>Hinduism</strong> represents a more developed and diverse form of spiritual tradition in India.</p>

      <b>Q1. Write down the characteristics of Paleolithic Age and Mesolithic Age – 5 Marks</b>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Paleolithic Age:</strong> This period is also called the Old Stone Age. People lived as hunter-gatherers and used crude stone tools. They lived in caves, depended on nature, and used fire. There was no concept of agriculture or permanent settlements.</p>
      <p><strong>Mesolithic Age:</strong> Known as the Middle Stone Age, this phase marked the transition to farming. Tools became sharper and more refined (microliths). People started domesticating animals and cultivating plants. They also began to form small settlements near water sources.</p>
      <p>In short, the Paleolithic Age was about survival and hunting, while the Mesolithic Age introduced early steps towards settled life and farming.</p>

      <b>Q2. Significance of Mehrgarh Civilization – 5 Marks</b>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Mehrgarh</strong> is one of the earliest known farming settlements in South Asia, located in present-day Balochistan, Pakistan. It dates back to around 7000 BCE.</p>
      <p>It is significant because it provides clear evidence of the transition from a nomadic life to a settled agricultural society. People grew wheat and barley, domesticated animals like sheep and goats, and lived in mud-brick houses.</p>
      <p>Mehrgarh also shows early use of pottery, tools, and ornaments made from stones and shells. Burial practices found here indicate belief in the afterlife.</p>
      <p>Thus, Mehrgarh marks the beginning of civilization in the Indian subcontinent and laid the foundation for later cultures like the Harappan civilization.</p>

      <b>Q3. Extent of Harappan Civilization – 5 Marks</b>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>The <strong>Harappan Civilization</strong>, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, was one of the world’s earliest urban cultures. It flourished between 2600 BCE and 1900 BCE.</p>
      <p>Its geographical extent covered a vast area of around <strong>1.25 million sq. km</strong>, making it larger than any other ancient civilization of its time.</p>

      <p>The civilization spread across parts of modern-day <strong>Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana</strong>, and even reached the <strong>Ganga-Yamuna Doab</strong> region.</p>
      <p>This vast spread shows the Harappans had a highly organized and connected society with strong trade and administrative systems.</p>

      <b>Q4. Position of Women in Vedic Era – 5 Marks</b>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>In the <strong>early Vedic era</strong>, women enjoyed a respectable position in society. They were allowed to participate in religious rituals and even compose hymns, like <strong>Gargi</strong> and <strong>Lopamudra</strong>.</p>
      <p>Women had access to <strong>education</strong> and could attend <strong>sabhas and samitis</strong> (community gatherings). Marriage was generally monogamous, and <strong>swayamvara</strong> was practiced.</p>
      <p>However, in the <strong>later Vedic period</strong>, their status declined. They were increasingly confined to domestic roles and denied education and participation in rituals.</p>
      <p>Child marriages and the practice of dowry also started becoming common, and women’s independence reduced over time.</p>
      <p>Thus, while women were empowered in early Vedic society, their position weakened in the later phase.</p>

      <b>Q5. Varna System of Vedic Era – 5 Marks</b>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>In the Vedic era, society was divided into four main <strong>varnas</strong> or social classes based on occupation and duties.</p>
      <p>These were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brahmins</strong> – Priests and teachers, responsible for religious rituals and knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Kshatriyas</strong> – Warriors and rulers who protected and governed society.</li>
        <li><strong>Vaishyas</strong> – Traders and farmers who managed agriculture and commerce.</li>
        <li><strong>Shudras</strong> – Servants and laborers who served the other three varnas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Originally, this system was flexible and based on <strong>karma</strong> (actions), not birth. But in the <strong>later Vedic period</strong>, it became rigid and hereditary, leading to social inequalities.</p>
      <p>This structure formed the foundation of the caste system in later Indian society.</p>
